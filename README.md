### Hi there, I make stuff. ðŸ‘‹

I am **[Icheng Lin](https://github.com/ichenglin)**, an teenage programmer passionate in **frontend** & **backend** development.
Most of my projects are inspired or designed for video games I used to play, therefore the majority of them are related to games.
It was my pleasure to cast dreams into actual programs, hoping them could help someone in some way.

Feel free to **contact me** through **[my website](https://runtimecloud.com/)**, **public email**, or **direct messages**.
As always, I am pleased to help anyone whenever I have the time.
